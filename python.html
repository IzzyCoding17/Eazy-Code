        Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language that is used in many areas of technology and science. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum with the goal of making programming more readable and less complex. Python uses clean, simple syntax—meaning the way it's written is similar to everyday English, making it easier for beginners to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike low-level languages like C or Assembly, Python is a high-level language, meaning it hides many technical details from the programmer. This lets you focus on solving problems instead of worrying about how the computer works internally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is an interpreted language, meaning you don’t need to compile your code before running it. The Python interpreter reads and runs the code line by line, which is helpful for testing and debugging. It’s also dynamically typed, so you don’t have to declare the type of data you’re working with—Python figures it out for you. This saves time and keeps your code clean.

        <h2>Beginner Level: Getting Started with Python</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="fonts-container">
        <p>
          At the beginner level, you're just getting introduced to Python and how programming works. You focus on learning how to write simple instructions that the computer can follow. What you learn:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>What Python is:</h3>
          <p>A very popular, beginner-friendly programming language used in web development, automation, AI, games, and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Basic concepts:</h3>
          <p>You understand things like storing data in variables, doing math, writing conditions ("if this, then that"), and making the computer repeat tasks (loops).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Structure and readability:</h3>
          <p>Python is known for being clean and easy to read. You learn the importance of indentation (spacing), and how Python is different from languages that use symbols like curly braces or semicolons.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Creating your own functions:</h3>
          <p>You begin to organize your code by grouping tasks into reusable blocks (functions).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h3>
          <p>You learn how to structure programs using classes and objects, which helps you manage bigger and more complex code.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Working with files and external data:</h3>
          <p>You learn how to read from and write to files, and how to interact with data from the internet or other programs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Data handling techniques:</h3>
          <p>You work with lists, dictionaries, and other structures in more advanced ways — filtering, sorting, combining data efficiently.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Advanced object-oriented design:</h3>
          <p>You explore powerful features like special methods and abstract classes to create reusable frameworks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Asynchronous and parallel programming:</h3>
          <p>You learn how to make your programs faster and more responsive by running multiple tasks at once (e.g., downloading files in the background).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Memory management and optimization:</h3>
          <p>You understand how Python handles memory and how to write faster and more efficient code.</p>
